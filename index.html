  <p>The purpose of this project is to analyze how weather
      changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish
      this analysis I pulled data from OpenWeatherMap API
      to assemble a dataset of over 500 cities.
      <br>
      After putting together the dataset we used Matplotlib to illustrate various 
      factors of weather vs. latitude. This site provides the source data as well as descriptions
      of trends witnessed.
